Causes of Bleach Poisoning in Dogs
Your dog is no different from other dogs that love to chew on plastic toys and think that they can put whatever they want in their mouths. Unfortunately, though, this only makes your dog prone to ingesting toxic materials, most of which could result in terrible side effects and sometimes, fatal results, if not immediately treated. 

Poisoning due to inhalation of fumes or ingestion of bleach can cause effects such as aspiration pneumonia, blood serum changes, kidney damage, corrosivity of the gastrointestinal tract, and blood coagulation abnormalities.

Diagnosis of Bleach Poisoning in Dogs
Once you take your dog to the veterinarian, you can expect that the goal is to immediately identify the poison in order to assess the contents. To do this, the veterinarian may induce vomiting and collect a sample of it in a plastic bag. If you administered any medication to your dog, you should take that along with you so the veterinarian can read the labels to see what is contained in it. If your dog has received burns to the mouth, it might take several hours to notice this. The stomach or esophagus may also be burned by the bleach. This may not be visible until an internal examination is done.

Treatment of Bleach Poisoning in Dogs
When you take the dog to the clinic or emergency hospital, your veterinarian may induce vomiting, or the stomach may be pumped using a method known as gastric lavage. 

 Activated charcoal may be administered as a way to bind the toxins.

After this, there are several ways that your veterinarian will introduce treatment. The immediate treatment is to flush the area that is most exposed. Your veterinarian may also administer fluid therapy, ulcer medication for possible stomach burn and of course, supportive care for other symptoms. 

Your veterinarian will use water to wash out the excess bleach from the mouth and fur. Even though this might seem simple, the veterinarian may also administer milk to soothe the stomach and dilute the ingested bleach.

Recovery of Bleach Poisoning in Dogs
After treatment, the dog is monitored for a few hours to a few days before being released. This allows the veterinarian to ensure that the dog does not have any further complications such as skin reactions or more vomiting. After the dog goes home, it is the pet’s owner’s responsibility to continue to monitor the situation, but also to make changes around the home such as crate training or putting the dog in a kennel. The pet owner should also adequately pet proof the home by removing all hazardous substances and storing them in a secure place, away from curious noses and paws.
